Sample Prompts:

General: Mark a bounding box that's over 45 sq.ht where there's a water nearby and mark it as a fire area, and a drone where it is near the bounding box and mention that it can spray water can do surveillence. Upload documents based on the prompts wherever you think it's necessary. The LLM can think recursively for 15 times and then it times out. The document samples are presnt in prompt_supplementary.

1. I have a marked area where there's a possibility of fire, and it started just now. I don't know where the fire could be within that area, but I also have a drone (marked). Could you give me the waypoints for the drone so that i) It can perform surveillence and ii) The drone can spray water on the fire area, so waypoint can be made in a way that it can extinguish the fire completely. Remember also to end the waypoint such that it ends at the place from where it started.
2. A hiker is missing in a mountainous region. I've marked a search area bounding box based on their last-known location. I've also marked a drone at the base camp. I need the drone to perform a thorough search pattern to find the hiker. The drone should prioritize areas near water sources and trails, as per the document titled 'Search and Rescue Protocol' that's been loaded. Generate the waypoints for the drone to cover the entire search area efficiently. The waypoints should also prioritize a lower altitude flight path for better visibility. The final waypoint should return the drone to the base camp.
3. I've marked a bounding box around my entire farm. I have a drone that can be used for monitoring. I need to check for signs of a specific crop disease. Generate a set of waypoints for the drone to fly over the farm. The path should be systematic, ensuring complete coverage of the area, and the drone should fly at a medium altitude to capture high-resolution imagery. If any area has a high-risk score for disease (let's say a score above 7), the drone should perform a second, more detailed pass at a lower altitude over that specific area. The final waypoint should land the drone back at its starting point.
4. I've marked a bounding box over a section of the forest that's known to be high-risk for fires. I have a drone available, which provides data on previous fire locations and factors like vegetation density. I need the drone to perform a patrol of this entire area. Generate a set of waypoints for the drone to fly a systematic pattern that gives the highest priority to the areas with a high risk score. The waypoints should be planned to maintain a consistent altitude for clear surveillance footage. The final waypoint should land the drone at a designated ranger station, which I've also marked as a point of interest.
5. A fire has started in a fire area bounding box I've marked. I have a drone that is currently spraying water on a specific point. While the drone is in action, I need to plan a firebreak. Could you give me a path for the firebreak? The firebreak should start from the location of the fire outpost (which I've marked as a point of interest) and extend to the nearest natural barrier, such as a river or a road. The path for the firebreak should be generated to avoid areas with a risk score above 8, as those areas have high fuel load and the fire could jump over it. The drone can be used for surveilling the entire area to give a better path.
6. A forest fire has been extinguished. I've marked a bounding box over the entire burn area. I have a drone that can be used for a post-fire assessment. I need the drone to fly over the entire area to assess the damage and identify any lingering hotspots. The drone should fly at a low altitude to capture detailed imagery of the ground. Generate a set of waypoints for the drone to cover the area in a tight grid pattern. Also, generate the risk score for all the points in the bounding box. The waypoints should also prioritize a lower altitude flight path for better visibility. If any risk score is above 4, I want the drone to perform a second, even lower altitude pass over that specific area to check for smoldering embers. The final waypoint should return the drone to its starting point.
